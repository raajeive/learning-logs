BASIC QUERY 

select the last 3 users

SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY id DESC
LIMIT 3;

select the posts and captions of the user 200

SELECT username, caption
FROM users
JOIN posts ON users.id = posts.user_id
WHERE users.id = 200

select users and number of likes they created_at

SELECT username, COUNT(*)
FROM users
JOIN likes ON likes.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY username

PERFORMANCE OF PostgreSQL

SHOW data_directory; ==> location of postgre stores data

oid to data base name relation

SELECT oid, datname
FROM pg_database;

SELECT * FROM pg_class; 

Heap or Heap File ==> File that contains all the data of our table

Tuple or Item ==> Individual row from the table

Block or Page ==> Heap file is divided in many different blocks or pages,
                  Each page/block stores some number of rows

Each block is 8KB large regarless of number of elements


BLOCK STRUCTURE 

PageHeaderData ==>24 Bytes
ItemidData ==> each itemid is 4 bytes long to points the start of the start of the data(item)
FreeSpace
Items ==> each item will start with item headers of 23bytes after that omly userdata will be there
SpecialSpace

Heap File:
Block0 ==> user1, user2
Block1 ==> user3, user4

SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE users.username = 'user1';

1. Heap file is loaded into the RAM 
2. Search for the username one by one
3 return the value

Full table is loaded on the RAM. ==> Full Table Scan

Index

DS that efficiently tell us which block/index a record is stored,
so you dont need to do full table scan.

1. Extract the oly property we want to do fast lookups by and the block.index for each.

2. Sort them in some order.

3. Store them in Tree DS.

4. Predefined Binary search with help string.
   (From root we can find do we need to check the child nodes or not)


CREATE INDEX ON users (username);

CREATE INDEX users_custom_name ON users (username);

DROP INDEX users_username_idx;

DROP INDEX users_custom_name;

EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE users.username = 'user1';

Check the execution time for query with and without index.

SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('users')):

SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('users_username_idx')):

- index takes aditional storeage
- insert/update/delete rows ==> causes additional time to update the same in index as well
- postgres not gurantee that will use index for the query

Types of index:

B-Tree
Hash
GiST
SP-GiST
GIN
BRIN

Auto Generated Index:

For primary key and the column with UNIQUE constraint,
postgres will create index automatically.

SELECT relname, relkind
FROM pg_class
WHERE relkind = 'i';

Index store on Disk

Index Page ==> with name of the index

There are differnt 8KB large blocks are stored inside the index page.

- Meta Page
- Root Block/Page
- Parent Block/Page
- Leaf Block/Page

CREATE EXTENSION pageinspect;

SELECT *
FROM bt_metap('users_username_idx');

SELECT *
FROM bt_page_item('users_username_idx', 3);

where 3 is the index of the root page.

ctid ==> page, index

SELECT ctid, * FROM users WHERE username = 'user1';

SELECT oid, datname FROM pg_database;

SHOW data_directory;

SELECT *
FROM pg_class
WHERE relkind = 'i';

Query Processing

SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE username = 'user1';

1. Parser ==> Creates the query tree bu parsing the query

2. Rewrite ==> Rewrites the query to make it efficient if possible

3. Planner ==> Plans how to execute query efficiently, (using index or Full table scan is decieded)

4. Execute ==> Executes the query and return the o/p

EXPLAIN ==> Tells postgres plan dto execute

EXPLAIN ANALYZE ==> Tells how it plans and Executes

EXPLANIN ANALYZE SELECT username, contents
FROM users
JOIN comments ON comments.user_id = users.id
WHERE users.id = 'user1';

Look at index file:

- Load the index file, find the column we need and its comment_id
- Load the DB file, go to correct block and index of data

Full table loading

- Load the full table
- go through each block and check for the query
- return the o/p

EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM likes
WHERE created_at < '2021-01-01';

CREATE INDEX likes_created_at_idx ON likes (created_at);

SELECT username, tags.created_at

    SELECT user_id, created_at FROM caption_tags
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user_id, created_at FROM posts_tags

COMMON TABLE EXPRESSION

WITH tags AS (
    SELECT user_id, created_at FROM caption_tags

    SELECT user_id, created_at FROM posts_tags

SELECT username, tags.created_at

RECURSIVE CTE

- used for when we use tree or graph DS

WITH RECURSIVE countdown (val) AS (
    SELECT 3 AS val (-- Initial, Non Recursive)
    UNION
    SELECT val - 1 FROM countdown WHERE val > 1 (-- Recursive)
)
SELECT *
FROM countdown;

1. Define the Results and working table
2. Execute the non recursive and initial and store it in the both resukts and working table
3. Run the recursive statement replacing the recurive (countdown) with reference to working table and
   replace the contents with new data on working table
4. if recursive statement return anything append with the results table and run recursion again 
5. if recursive statement return nothing then stop the recursion.

Finaly resturn the working table and rename it as the recursive function (countdown).

Result table            Working table
3                         3

FOLLOWING SUGGESTION INSTAGRAM

if user A (id = 1000) follows B and C, suggest who B and C follows and so on.

WITH RECURSIVE suggestion(leader_id, follower_id, depth) AS (
        SELECT leader_id, follower_id, 1 AS depth
        FROM followers
        WHERE follower_id = 1000
    UNION
        SELECT followers.leader_id, followers.follower_id, depth + 1
        FROM followers
        JOIN suggestion ON suggestion.leader_id = followers.follower_id
        WHERE depth < 3
)

SELECT DISTINCT users.id, users.username
FROM suggestions
JOIN users ON users.id = suggestion.leader_id
WHERE depth > 1
LIMIT 30;

VIEWS

Most popular user ==> most tagged user on posts and caption.

SELECT
FROM users
JOIN (
    SELECT user_id FROM posts_tags
    UNION ALL
    SELECT user_id FROm caption_tags
) AS tags ON tags.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY username
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;

posts_tags and caption_tags are union for this query everytime.

better to have 1 table, its a desing mistake.

solution #1
- create new tag table
- copy the posts and caption tags table

CREATE TABLE tags (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL,
    posts_id INTEGER REFERENCES posts(id) NOT NULL,
    x_coordinate REAL,
    y_coordinate REAL
);

INSERT INTO tags (created_at, updated_at, user_id, post_id, x_coordinate, y_coordinate)
SELECT created_at, updated_at, user_id, post_id, x_coordinate, y_coordinate
FROM posts_tags;

INSERT INTO tags (created_at, updated_at, user_id, post_id)
SELECT created_at, updated_at, user_id, post_id
FROM caption_tags;

we cant have the unique id for both while copying the id, changing the id might break the app somewhere.
And posts and caption tags queries will fail.

solution #2

VIEWS

CREATE VIEW tags AS (
    SELECT id, created_at, user_id, posts_id, 'posts_tags' AS type FROM posts_tags
    UNION ALL
    SELECT id, created_at, user_id, posts_id, 'caption_tags' AS type FROM caption_tags
)

SELECT * FROM tags;

SELECT
FROM users
JOIN tags ON tags.user_id = users.id
GROUP BY username
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1;

most recent posts (latest 10):

CREATE VIEW recent_posts AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM posts
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    LIMIT 10
);

SELECT * FROM recent_posts;

SELECT *
FROM recent_posts
JOIN users ON users.id = recent_posts.user_id;

change or alter the existing VIEW

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW recent_posts AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM posts
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    LIMIT 15
);

delete a VIEW

DROP VIEW recent_posts;

TRANSACTIONS

CREATE TABLE accounts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    balance INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK balance >= 0
);

user1 send money to user 2

withdraw 50 from user 1

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 50
WHERE username = 'user1'

CRASH happened

add 50 to user2

UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 50
WHERE username = 'user2'

TRANSACTIONS
- it will allow the connection# to create a sparate work space other than main database
- any change on that wont affect the main database until we commit the change from work DB

BEGIN ==> will start the TRANSACTIONS

COMMIT ==> will commit the work db to main db

ROLLBACK ==> will drop the workdb and the connection will start point to main db. (includes Error and crash case)

Error in transaction ==> move the transaction to aborted state, should to ROLLBACK.
